To predict the employee attrition based on general employee data

Employee Attrition Prediction
First of all I would like to thank Consultancy and Analytics Club of IIT Guwahati, for conducting such a wonderful hackathon. It was really fun in applying what we learned in the course. Also this has been an ice breaker for me as from now onwards I can start kaggling. Here I share my first kernel, do upvote it if you find it helpful.

As the COVID-19 keeps unleashing its havoc, the world continues to get pushed into the crisis of the great economic recession, more and more companies start to cut down their underperforming employees. Companies firing hundreds and thousands of Employees is a typical headline today. Cutting down employees or reducing an employee salary is a tough decision to take. Here in this project we look at various parameters responsible for attrition of employee and at the end will build a model to predict Employee Attrition.
